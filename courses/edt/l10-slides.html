      ## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"
      
      "Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse."
      
      "Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves."
      
      "We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls."
      
      "Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups."
      
      ???
      
      Here are some quotes from Facebook's own research into the effects Instagram has on teens

      ## The Island Doctor
      
      You, an accomplished surgeon, are stranded on a deserted island with six other people. The island just happens to have a well-stocked surgical center on it. You learn that five of your six companions have diseases that could be cured with a suitable organ transplant. Each of them needs a different organ. If they do not get a transplant, they will suffer greatly before dying. If they do, they will live long, healthy lives.
      
      One day, Adam—the sixth, perfectly healthy inhabitant of the island—walks into your clinic with a sprained ankle. It occurs to you that you could knock him out, remove his organs, and tell the others that you found the organs in storage, and have no idea what happened to the missing person. You believe, accurately, that you could pull off this plan.

      ## Consequentialism and non-consequentialism
      
      **Consequentialism:** whether an action is morally permissible is determined exclusively by how good its consequences would be, relative to other possible actions
      
      - *Slogan:* how could it be wrong to do the thing that would have the very best consequences?
      
      **Non-consequentialism:** whether an action is morally permissible is not determined exclusively by how good its consequences would be
      
      - *Slogan:* there are some things you shouldn’t do, no matter how good the consequences would be!
      
      ---
      
      ## Consequentialism and non-consequentialism
      
      **Non-consequentialists** can explain our judgment in Island Doctor
      
      - Nonconsequentialists agree with utilitarians that promoting the wellbeing of others is a morally important **goal**
      - But they also think that there are important **constraints** on how we may pursue that goal
      
      --
      
      ### "rights as side constraints"
      
      One view: individuals have **rights** that place constraints on how we interact with them
      
      ???
      
      For example, the right not to be harmed or killed

      ![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)
      
      "In contrast to incorporating rights into the end state to be achieved, one might place them as **side constraints** upon the actions to be done: don't violate constraints C. The rights of others determine the constraints upon your actions. (A ***goal-directed* view** with constraints added would be: aong those acts available to you that don't violate constraints C, act so as to maximize goal G.)"
      
      ???
      
      Here's Nozick elaborating on the idea of rights as moral side constraints.
      
      What does he mean here?

      ![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)
      
      "Side constraints upon action reflect the underlying Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means; they may not be sacrificed or used for the achieving of other ends without their consent. **Individuals are inviolable**."
      
      ---
      
      ## "Individuals are inviolable"
      
      Does this mean that we can **never** use others to achieve our own goals?

      Nozick:
      
      > It is sufficient that the other party stands to gain enough from the exchange so that he is **willing** to go through with it"
      
      > "Another party, however, who would not **choose** to interact with you if he knew of the uses to which you *intend* to put his actions or good, *is* being used as a [mere] means"

      ![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)
      
      “Why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm . . . Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good?”
      
      ???
      
      Here's a famous passage from the Nozick reading that further explains how non-consequentialists think about cases like Island Doctor
      
      ---
      
      class: img-left-full
      
      ![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large-20210922114001935.jpg)
      
      “But **there is no social entity** with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. . . . To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a **separate person**, that his is the only life he has.”
      
      ???
      
      Another way of putting the same point: the utilitarian treats us as if we are mere containers of happiness---that it's the happiness that matters, rather than the people who are happy.

      # Beneficence and non-maleficence
      
      ???
      
      So far, we have been talking about one of the key motivations for non-consquentialism -- the idea that we have rights, and that those rights impose side constraints on how we can treat others.
      
      Now we're going to talk about two moral principles that are widely accepted, the principle of beneficence and the principle of non-maleficence.
      
      ---
      
      ## The principle of beneficence
      
      We are morally obligated to **help others**
      
      --
      
      Questions
      
      - **who** are we obligated to help?
      - **when** and **how much** are we obligated to help?
      - what **sacrifices** are we obligated to make?
      
      ???
      
      While most nonconsequentialists agree that we are obligated to help others to **at least some extent**, they disagree about the nature of that obligation
      
      --
      
      ### The principle of utility
      
      You always ought to do whatever would produce the greatest **total** amount of happiness possible
      
      ???
      
      Classical utilitarians have a particularly demanding interpretation of the principle of beneficence
      
      ---
      
      ## The principle of non-maleficence
      
      We are morally obligated not to **harm** others
      
      ???
      
      Island doctor case is supposed to show that we are not just obligated to help others, we are also obligated not to harm them

      Who can tell me about the Tuskeegee syphillis study?
      
      ---
      
      Wikipedia:
      
      > The [Tuskeegee syphillis study] ... was an ethically abusive study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African Americans with syphillis. The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment, and more than 100 died as a result.

      ## Non-maleficence
      
      We are morally obligated not to **harm** others
      
      The Belmont Report:
      
      >"The Hippocratic maxim 'do no harm' has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benefits that might come to others."

      ---
      
      ## Non-maleficence
      
      We are morally obligated not to harm others **except** when...?
      
      ### Questions
      
      1. What does Nozick say about this?
      2. What do you think?
      
      ???
      
      Disagreement over what **exceptions** there are
      
      Is it **always** wrong to harm someone in order to benefit others, or are there exceptions?
      
      1. Self-defense
      2. Minor harms in exchange for great benefits
      3. Just punishment
      4. Civilian casualties
      5. Significant harms to prevent great tragedies (ticking time bomb scenarios)

      ## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"
      
      "The research that we've seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits"
      
      &mdash;Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook CEO)
      
      "There's a lot of good that comes with what we do."
      
      &mdash;Adam Mosseri (Instagram CEO)
      
      ???
      
      One way Facebook leaders have tried to defend the company: arguing that Instagram has many positive effects on mental health, and that the harms affect a minority of users
      
      ---
      
      ## Discussion questions
      
      1. Is Facebook morally obligated to modify Instagram in ways that would reduce its harmful effects on teens? Why or why not?
      
      2. What is Facebook obligated to do about the problem, if anything?
      3. Suppose further research provides abundant evidence that using Instagram significantly raises some teens' risk of being harmed in serious ways&mdash;that it significantly raises their risk of mental illness (anxiety, depression, eating disorders) and suicide. Would Facebook be obligated to shut the site down or take similarly drastic measures, at least until the problem is fixed? Why or why not?
