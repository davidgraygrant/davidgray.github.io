# Instructions

If you are in person:

- Take **one** red, yellow, and green card
- **Write your name** on your cards

Cards have a **priority order**
- Red = highest priority
- Yellow = medium priority
- Green = lowest priority


---
# Instructions (in person)

**Finger** = I want to follow up on someone else's comment

**Hand** = my comment is not a follow-up

Give **used cards** to Sophie

---

# Instructions (on Zoom)

Type "**finger** - [card color]" = I want to follow up on someone else's comment

Type "**hand** - [card color]" = my comment is not a follow-up

# Dilemma

&ldquo;[The agent] recommended that the intervention team put the youth currently at highest risk of drug abuse into one group, and divide the youth at lower risk among the remaining groups&rdquo;

Predicted result:

1. **Increase risk** for users
2. **Decrease risk** for nonusers
3. **Minimize** overall drug use

The researchers believed these predictions were **probably correct**

???

Significantly increased risk for users, but significantly decreased risk for nonusers

# Would it be **morally permissible** to conduct such an intervention?

---
1. Who are the **stakeholders**? How might they be affected positively or negatively by the intervention?
1. What is the best utilitarian argument **for** conducting the intervention?
1. What is the best utilitarian argument **against** conducting the intervention?
1. Setting utilitarianism aside, why else might someone think that conducting the intervention would be **morally wrong**? Are they right?
1. Assume that conducting the intervention would be wrong. What changes could we make to **the GUIDE algorithm** to address the problem?
1. Assume that conducting the intervention would be wrong. What changes could we make to **other aspects of the intervention** to address the problem?

## Question 1 (9:40-9:45)

Who are the **stakeholders**? How might they be affected positively or negatively by the intervention?

---
## Question 2 (9:45-9:55)

What is the best utilitarian argument **for** conducting the intervention?

---

## Question 3 (9:55-10:05)

What is the best utilitarian argument **against** conducting the intervention?

---

## Question 4 (10:05-10:15)

Setting utilitarianism aside, why else might someone think that conducting the intervention would be **morally wrong**? Are they right?

---
## Question 5 (10:15-10:20)

Assume that conducting the intervention would be wrong. What changes could we make to **the GUIDE algorithm** to address the problem?

???

Start with changes to the algorithm itself, then talk about nonalgorithmic changes

---
## Question 6 (10:20-10:25)

Assume that conducting the intervention would be wrong. What changes could we make to **other aspects of the intervention** to address the problem?
