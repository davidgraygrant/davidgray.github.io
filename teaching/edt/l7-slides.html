# Facebook's Deep Learning Recommendation Model (DLRM)

Key role in several recent ethics scandals:

1. Exempting celebrities from **community standards**
2. Instagram's **mental health impact** on teens
3. Prioritizing content that makes users **angry**
4. Widespread **hate speech**
5. Widespread **COVID-19 misinformation**

What exactly did the Wall Street Journal find?

---

## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"

"Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse."

"Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves."

"We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls."

"Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups."

???

Here are some quotes from Facebook's own research into the effects Instagram has on teens

# Question

![image-20210922145923442](image-20210922145923442.png)

What is Facebook **morally obligated** to do about Instagram's negative mental health impacts on teens?

???

We'll consider both what a utilitarian should say, and how a nonconsequentialist would approach the question

---

#Agenda

1. Moral goals and moral constraints
2. Beneficence and non-maleficence
3. Instagram and non-maleficence

---

class: sectiontitle

# Moral goals and moral constraints

---

## The principle of utility

You always ought to do whatever would produce the greatest **total** amount of happiness possible

---

class: img-left-full

## A problem for utilitarianism

![](island doctor book.png)

Most people think it would be seriously wrong to kill Adam and redistribute his organs

It seems like the utilitarian has to deny this!

---

## Consequentialism and non-consequentialism

**Consequentialism:** whether an action is morally permissible is determined exclusively by how good its consequences would be, relative to other possible actions

- *Slogan:* how could it be wrong to do the thing that would have the very best consequences?

**Non-consequentialism:** whether an action is morally permissible is not determined exclusively by how good its consequences would be

- *Slogan:* there are some things you shouldn’t do, no matter how good the consequences would be!

---

## Consequentialism and non-consequentialism

**Non-consequentialists** can easily explain our judgment in Island Doctor

- Nonconsequentialists agree with utilitarians that promoting the wellbeing of others is a morally important **goal**
- But they also think that there are important **constraints** on how we may pursue that goal

--

### "rights as side constraints"

One view: individuals have **rights** that place constraints on how we interact with them

???

For example, the right not to be harmed or killed

---

class: img-left-full

![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)

"In contrast to incorporating rights into the end state to be achieved, one might place them as **side constraints** upon the actions to be done: don't violate constraints C. The rights of others determine the constraints upon your actions. (A ***goal-directed* view** with constraints added would be: aong those acts available to you that don't violate constraints C, act so as to maximize goal G.)"

???

Here's Nozick elaborating on the idea of rights as moral side constraints.

What does he mean here?

---

## Three conceptions of rights

Two consequentialist conceptions of rights:

- If people in our society act as if we have rights, then there will be **more happiness** overall.
- Rights violations are (very) **bad for their own sake**, so respecting rights will normally produce the best consequences.

???

Two consequentialist ways to understand rights:

1. Rights are derivative from consequences—having a society that treats individuals as if they have inalienable rights will lead to the best consequences in the long run.
2. Rights partly constitute good consequences—the non-violation of rights is good for its own sake. Con- versely, the violation of an individual’s rights is bad for its own sake. How good the consequences of an action or institution are is partly determined by the extent to which it would lead to individuals’ rights being violated.

Neither of these gets us **inviolable** rights. 

--

Nozick's nonconsequentialist alternative:

- Rights are **side constraints** on producing good consequences.

???

So Nozick proposes a nonconsequentialist alternative:

(3) Rights are side-constraints on maximizing good consequences—individuals have rights that we ought not violate even if the world would be better if we violated them.

---

![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)

"Side constraints upon action reflect the underlying Kantian principle that individuals are ends and not merely means; they may not be sacrificed or used for the achieving of other ends without their consent. **Individuals are inviolable**."

---

## "Individuals are inviolable"

Does this mean that we can **never** use others to achieve our own goals?

???

Am I not permitted to use the cashier at the grocery store as a means to get groceries?

Is it morally wrong for me to require you to take exams in this class, considering that you would prefer that I just give you all an 'A' without all the trouble?

--

Nozick:

> It is sufficient that the other party stands to gain enough from the exchange so that he is **willing** to go through with it"

> "Another party, however, who would not **choose** to interact with you if he knew of the uses to which you *intend* to put his actions or good, *is* being used as a [mere] means"

---

![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large.jpg)

“Why may not one violate persons for the greater social good? Individually, we each sometimes choose to undergo some pain or sacrifice for a greater benefit or to avoid a greater harm . . . Why not, similarly, hold that some persons have to bear some costs that benefit other persons more, for the sake of the overall social good?”

???

Here's a famous passage from the Nozick reading that further explains how non-consequentialists think about cases like Island Doctor

---

class: img-left-full

![Anarchy, State, and Utopia: Critical Exposition – manwithoutqualities](wk_57696_38511_large-20210922114001935.jpg)

“But **there is no social entity** with a good that undergoes some sacrifice for its own good. There are only individual people, different individual people, with their own individual lives. Using one of these people for the benefit of others, uses him and benefits the others. . . . To use a person in this way does not sufficiently respect and take account of the fact that he is a **separate person**, that his is the only life he has.”

???

Another way of putting the same point: the utilitarian treats us as if we are mere containers of happiness---that it's the happiness that matters, rather than the people who are happy.

# Beneficence and non-maleficence

???

So far, we have been talking about one of the key motivations for non-consquentialism -- the idea that we have rights, and that those rights impose side constraints on how we can treat others.

Now we're going to talk about two moral principles that are widely accepted, the principle of beneficence and the principle of non-maleficence.

---

class: small

## The principle of beneficence

We are morally obligated to **help others**

--

Questions

- **who** are we obligated to help?
- **when** and **how much** are we obligated to help?
- what **sacrifices** are we obligated to make?

???

While most nonconsequentialists agree that we are obligated to help others to **at least some extent**, they disagree about the nature of that obligation

--

### The principle of utility

You always ought to do whatever would produce the greatest **total** amount of happiness possible

???

Classical utilitarians have a particularly demanding interpretation of the principle of beneficence

---

## The principle of non-maleficence

We are morally obligated not to **harm** others

???

Island doctor case is supposed to show that we are not just obligated to help others, we are also obligated not to harm them

--

>"The Hippocratic maxim 'do no harm' has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benefits that might come to others."

## The Tuskegee syphillis study

![image-20210922141308572](image-20210922141308572.png)

???

Who can tell me about the Tuskeegee syphillis study?

---

Wikipedia:

> The [Tuskeegee syphillis study] ... was an ethically abusive study conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the United States Public Health Service (PHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on a group of nearly 400 African Americans with syphillis. The purpose of the study was to observe the effects of the disease when untreated, though by the end of the study it was entirely treatable. The men were not informed of the nature of the experiment, and more than 100 died as a result.

---

## Non-maleficence

We are morally obligated not to **harm** others

The Belmont Report:

>"The Hippocratic maxim 'do no harm' has long been a fundamental principle of medical ethics. Claude Bernard extended it to the realm of research, saying that one should not injure one person regardless of the benefits that might come to others."

???

("Ethical Principles and Guidelines for the Protection of Human Subjects of Research")

---

## Non-maleficence

We are morally obligated not to harm others **except** when...?

### Questions

1. What does Nozick say about this?
2. What do you think?

???

Disagreement over what **exceptions** there are

Is it **always** wrong to harm someone in order to benefit others, or are there exceptions?

1. Self-defense
2. Minor harms in exchange for great benefits
3. Just punishment
4. Civilian casualties
5. Significant harms to prevent great tragedies (ticking time bomb scenarios)

# Instagram and non-maleficence

---

## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"

"The research that we've seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits"

&mdash;Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook CEO)

"There's a lot of good that comes with what we do."

&mdash;Adam Mosseri (Instagram CEO)

???

One way Facebook leaders have tried to defend the company: arguing that Instagram has many positive effects on mental health, and that the harms affect a minority of users

---

## Discussion questions

Suppose further research provides abundant evidence that using Instagram significantly raises some teens' risk of being harmed in serious ways&mdash;that it significantly raises their risk of mental illness (anxiety, depression, eating disorders) and suicide. 

**Ethical question:** would Facebook be obligated to shut the site down or take similarly drastic measures, at least until the problem is fixed? 

1. What would a utilitarian say?
1. Would would Nozick say?
1. What do you think?

# Moral principles and moral guides

---

## Another problem for utilitarianism

It's impossible to predict with any confidence what the long-run consequences of any given action will be

So we are rarely (if ever) in a position to know what we ought to do, if utilitarianism is true!

???
J.S. Mill, writing in the 1860s, was aware of this problem

Here's what he had to say about it

---

## Mill's solution to both problems

"Defenders of utility often find themselves called upon to reply to such objections as this&mdash;that there is not time, previous to action, for calculating and weighing the effects of any line of conduct on the general happiness."

--

"The answer to the objection is, that there has been ample time, namely, the whole past duration of the human species. During all that time, mankind have been learning by experience the tendencies of actions; on which experience all the prudence, as well as all the morality of life, are dependent."

???
So the idea here is that, most of the time, we should follow commonsense moral rules such as "do not steal" and "do not kill"

**Q** what do you think Mill would say about the Island Doctor case?

---

## Moral principles

**Moral principle** = a claim about what we ought to do in a fairly wide range of cases

Examples:

- We always ought to perform the action available to us that would produce the most well-being (the principle of utility)
- We ought not to harm innocent people (the principle of non-maleficence)

???
We can put the general point Mill is making more precisely in terms of the idea of a moral principle

---

## Moral standards vs. moral guides

Two kinds of moral principles:

1. **Moral standards** specify conditions under which actions are morally required, permitted, or prohibited
2. **Moral guides** offer guidance to agents about how to determine whether an action is morally required, permitted, or prohibited

---

## Moral standards vs. moral guides

The principle of utility is a moral standard, not a moral guide

Using the principle of utility as a moral guide would be

-  **impossible** most of the time
-  **disastrous** (e.g., the Tuskegee syphillis experiment)

---

## Mill's harm principle

"The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others'' (On Liberty)"

???
In fact, Mill thought that we should be extremely cautious about interfering with other people's lives in an attempt to maximize wellbeing for the broader society

Here's a moral guide that Mill argues for in his book On Liberty, which had a huge impact on the development of democratic political theory

Mill makes clear that by "harm" here, he means the immediate threat of physical harm. For example, Mill thought that you should almost never interfere with the speech of others, even if you think the views that they are spreading are very dangerous. So he thought that you needed an extremely strong case in order to justify coercively interfering with others

We'll come back to this next week when we talk about autonomy and free speech

---

## Broad agreement in practice but not theory

Ethical theories endorse **different moral standards**

However, in practice they tend to accept many of the **same moral guides**

- Broad agreement about what moral goals and constraints should guide our behavior

???
More generally, while it might initially seem like ethicists don't agree about very much, it turns out that there is actually broad agreement about what we ought to do in particular cases
