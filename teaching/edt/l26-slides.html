# L26 Fourth Case Study

---

ProPublica’s analysis of data from Broward County, FL found that COMPAS fails to satisfy Equal False Positive Rates. ProPublica concluded that COMPAS is unfairly biased against black defendants. Explain why someone might think that this follows from ProPublica’s findings.

---

Northpointe and others responded by arguing that COMPAS satisfies Equal Calibration, and that this shows that COMPAS is not unfairly biased against black defendants. Explain why someone might think the latter claim follows from the former claim.

---

Suppose that base rates of recidivism differ for black and white defendants, and that as a result we cannot satisfy both Equal Specificity and Equal Calibration. Should COMPAS be designed to (a) satisfy Equal Calibration, (b) satisfy Equal Specificity, or (c) satisfy both to some degree, but imperfectly? Why?

---

Why else might someone think that using COMPAS to make pretrial detention decisions is unfair? Are they right?

---

What changes should be made to the COMPAS algorithm, the practice of pretrial detention, or the criminal justice system in response to the ethical challenges you have identified? Why? (If you think no changes should be made, say so and explain why.)
