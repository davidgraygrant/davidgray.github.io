# L26 Fourth Case Study

---

Who are the stakeholders in the COMPAS case studyâ€”the people who stand to be affected positively or negatively by how COMPAS is designed and used?

How might their rights or interests be affected?

---

Suppose that base rates of recidivism differ for black and white defendants, and that as a result we cannot satisfy both Equal Specificity and Equal Calibration. 

Should COMPAS be designed to (a) satisfy Equal Calibration, (b) satisfy Equal Specificity, or (c) satisfy both to some degree, but imperfectly? Why?

---

Why else might someone think that using COMPAS to make pretrial detention decisions is unfair? Are they right?

---

What changes should be made to the COMPAS algorithm, the practice of pretrial detention, or the criminal justice system in response to the ethical challenges you have identified? Why? (If you think no changes should be made, say so and explain why.)
