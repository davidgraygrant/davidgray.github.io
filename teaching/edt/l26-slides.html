# L26 Fourth Case Study

---

Who are the stakeholders in the COMPAS case studyâ€”the people who stand to be affected positively or negatively by how COMPAS is designed and used?

How might their rights or interests be affected?

---

Suppose that base rates of recidivism differ for black and white defendants, and that as a result we cannot satisfy both Equal Specificity and Equal Calibration. 

Should COMPAS be designed to (a) satisfy Equal Calibration, (b) satisfy Equal Specificity, or (c) satisfy both to some degree, but imperfectly? Why?

It is possible to modify the algorithm to equalize the false-positive rates for the two groups, but at a cost. Figure 2 below represents one possible modifica- tion: predicting arrest for a greater proportion of the black group. For both the black and the gray groups, now 25% of the *non-rearrestees* (the solid figures) are mistakenly forecast for rearrest. That is, the false-positive rate is 25% for each group. The total number of people forecast for rearrest is also much closer across groups. But notice the effect on the accuracy of the rearrest forecasts themselves (depicted by the dividing line between figures). For the gray group, a prediction of rearrest is still 50% likely to be true. But it is only about 30% likely to be true for the black group. When the algorithm is deployed prospectively, a rearrest forecast will mean something different depending on whether the figure is gray or black.

Why else might someone think that using COMPAS to make pretrial detention decisions is unfair? Are they right?

---

What changes should be made to the COMPAS algorithm, the practice of pretrial detention, or the criminal justice system in response to the ethical challenges you have identified? Why? (If you think no changes should be made, say so and explain why.)
