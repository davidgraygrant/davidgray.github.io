      Cal Newport's definition:
      
      > ‘A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else’. A philosophy of technology use is a personal philosophy that ‘covers [...] which digital tools we allow into our life, for what reasons, and under what constraints’.

      Aylsworth and Castro's definition:
      
      > [W]e understand a digital minimalist as one whose interactions with digital technology are intentional, such that they do not conflict with their ends. For most, being a minimalist will involve a serious reduction &ndash; in some cases to the point of elimination &ndash; of interaction with smartphones, smartphone apps, and social media sites. For some it may even require living up to Newport’s ideal.
      
      ???

      # Rational autonomy
      
      ---
      
      ## Definition of rational autonomy
      
      Rational autonomy = the capacity for **rational self-governance**
      
      - "autonomy" = "auto" + "nomos" = self + law
      
      ???
      
      Castro and Pham call this "cognitive agency" but mean the same thing
      
      --
      
      Two component capacities:
      
      1. **Set goals**
      2. **Pursue goals**
      
      ???
      
      Two component capacities involved in autonomy as self-governance:
      
      1. **Set goals** - choose what goals (ends) you will pursue
      2. **Pursue goals** - regulate your behavior in a way that is conducive to promoting those goals 
      
      --
      
      Distinct from autonomy as **power**
      
      ???
      
      Distinct from autonomy as **power** = having access to the resources necessary to achieve your goals, e.g. money, ability to influence others, physical strength
      
      - Can come apart from autonomy as self-governance; e.g. mad King George had enormous power but not rational autonomy

      ## Steps in the Hooked Model
      
      ![](61flY+vDb9L.jpg)
      
      1. **Trigger**
      2. **Queue an action**
      3. **Variable reward**
      4. **Investment**
      
      ???
      
      1. **Trigger** the user - bring notification to app using e.g. notifications
      2. **Queue an action** - that will be done in anticipation of a reward
      3. **Give a variable reward** - tie the action to outcomes that are sometimes very rewarding (perhaps a slew of “likes”) and at other times mundane (perhaps *another* picture of an acquaintance’s cat).  
      4. **Investment** - have the user "put something into the product, such as a new photo or post, or their contact information, and is meant to increase the chance that the user will pass through another "Hook Cycle" in the future

      ## Effects of smartphone addition

      Effects of smartphone addiction on rational autonomy?
      
      --
      
      > Smartphone addiction poses a distinct threat to our rational capacities because an effect of the addiction is susceptibility to having one’s attention hijacked at frequent intervals, interrupting one’s ongoing tasks.
      
      > By forfeiting some of our agency to our phones (or other addictive devices), we diminish our capacity to pursue the ends that we have set for ourselves and instead serve the interests of the developers of those products, which usually involves spending as much time on our devices as possible.

      ## Rational autonomy and noxious markets
      
      Castro and Pham: the market in new media is **noxious** because participants in it have **weakened rational autonomy**
      
      ???
      
      Castro and Pham: the market in new media is **noxious** because participants in it have **weakened rational autonomy**
      
      Why is that supposed to be morally problematic?
      
      We typically assume that market transactions are **voluntary**, e.g. me buying a truly hideous new pair of pants.
      
      - If we believe freedom is important, then we have a reason not to interfere with voluntary transactions -- even if participants are likely to be harmed to some degree
      - Further, harms that result can be justified as consensual, at least if participants were in a position to know about the risks
      
      But if transactions in a market are not voluntary, then the presumption against government interference is weakened
      
      - If they're not voluntary, then they're not free, and the freedom-based argument against government interference in the market does not apply
      - If they're not voluntary, then they may be coercive or exploitative -- at least plausible the government has an obligation to protect people from coercion and exploitation
      - If they're not voluntary, any harms that result cannot be justified as consensual -- so there's a case for the government to step in to pretoet from those harms

      ## A duty to protect rational autonomy
      
      You have **self-interested** reasons to care about your rational autonomy
      
      ???
      
      You have **self-interested** reasons to care about your rational autonomy
      
      - If your rational autonomy is weakened, then it will be more difficult for you to achieve your goals
      
      --
      
      Aylsworth and Castro: 
      
      - we are **morally obligated** to protect our rational autonomy
      - the obligation is **self-directed**
      
      ???
      
      Aylsworth and Castro argue that you don't just have self-interested reasons to care about your rational autonomy&mdash;you have a **moral obligation** to protect it
      
      - This is supposed to be a **moral obligation**
      - It's an obligation to **yourself** (self-directed duty), not others
      
      Why? Because rational autonomy is incredibly valuable&mdash;so valuable that is deserves our protection

      ## The value of rational autonomy
      
      ![](kant.jpg)
      
      The value of rational autonomy is:
      
      1. **Objective**
      2. **Unconditional**
      3. **Non-fungible**
      
      ???
      
      Immanuel Kant (1724-1804): we have a moral obligation to respect rational autonomy in ourself and in others.
      
      Why? Because of the value of rational autonomy. Its value is:
      
      1. **Objective:** "is one that holds for all rational agents, and this is contrasted with relative value, which requires the presence of a contingent inclination. For instance, the value of a chocolate cake is merely relative, because it has value only insofar as agents desire it."
      2. **Unconditional:** "Value of this kind cannot be lost, and it holds in all contexts."
      3. **Non-fungible:** "human beings have the kind of value that does not admit of exchanges for things of equal value."
      
      Since rational autonomy is so incredibly valuable, we are morally obligated to **respect** it in both ourselves and in others

      ## Respect for rational autonomy
      
      ![](kant.jpg)
      
      We are **morally obligated** to show **respect** for rational autonomy in ourselves and others.
      
      ???
      
      Kant thought that showing respect for rational autonomy requires never using others in ways they would not consent to
      
      - Many nonconsequentialist philosophers, like Nozick, have agreed
      
      Kant also thought that respecting autonomy in yourself requires protecting your own autonomy 
      
      - Kant argued on that basis that you are morally obligated not to commit suicide
      
      ---
      
      ## The duty to protect our rational autonomy
      
      We have a self-directed moral duty to protect our rational autonomy because:
      
      - It is incredibly **valuable**
      - It is **necessary** for us to achieve any of our other goals
      
      ???
      
      A&C don't necessarily agree about that, but they do think that we have a moral obligation to protect our rational economy in various ways.
      
      - For example, if staying up late every night partying and never getting enough sleep would undermine your ability to set rational goals and behave in ways that are conducive to promoting them, then you have a moral obligation not to do that
      - Similarly, A&C think we plausibly owe it to ourselves to protect ourselves from physical addictions that would impair our autonomy

      ## The duty to be a digital minimalist
      
      > Wireless mobile devices can weaken our rational agency. They distract us, shorten our attention spans, and make it harder for us to stick to a difficult task. Insofar as we value rational agency, we ought to recognize the threat that these devices pose to it. We should be intentional about how we use them in order to safeguard our capacity to set ends for ourselves and pursue those ends. And that is precisely what it means to be a digital minimalist.

      ## The duty to be a digital minimalist
      
      ![](81-g2qRUwAL.jpg)
      
      Since we have a duty to protect our own rational autonomy, we have a duty to be **digital minimalists**
      
      - "one whose interactions with digital technology are **intentional**, such that they do not conflict with their [goals]"
      
      ???
      
      But they think that smartphone addiction plausibly has an even more severe effect on our autonomy than other kinds of addictions. Two reasons:
      
      1. Because it leads us to spend time doing things new media companies want us to do, rather than the things *we* want to do
      2. Because it produces a state of constant distractedness that makes us less effective at pursuing our goals
      
      Since we have a duty to protect our rational autonomy, then, we have a duty to protect ourselves from smartphone addiction by becoming digital minimalists.
