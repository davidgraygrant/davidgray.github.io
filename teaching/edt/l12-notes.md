# **L12** Digital Minimalism

![](81-g2qRUwAL.jpg)

## What is digital minimalism?

Cal Newport's definition:

> ‘A philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected and optimized activities that strongly support things you value, and then happily miss out on everything else’. A philosophy of technology use is a personal philosophy that ‘covers [...] which digital tools we allow into our life, for what reasons, and under what constraints’.

---

Aylsworth and Castro adopt a less demanding definition:

> [W]e understand a digital minimalist as one whose interactions with digital technology are intentional, such that they do not conflict with their ends. For most, being a minimalist will involve a serious reduction &ndash; in some cases to the point of elimination &ndash; of interaction with smartphones, smartphone apps, and social media sites. For some it may even require living up to Newport’s ideal.

# Rational autonomy

## Definition of rational autonomy

Rational autonomy = the capacity for **rational self-governance**

- "autonomy" = "auto" + "nomos" = self + law
- Castro and Pham call this "cognitive agency" but mean the same thing

## Two component capacities

Two component capacities involved in autonomy as self-governance:

1. **Set goals** - choose what goals (ends) you will pursue
2. **Pursue goals** - regulate your behavior in a way that is conducive to promoting those goals 

## Distinct from autonomy as power

Distinct from autonomy as **power** = having access to the resources necessary to achieve your goals, e.g. money, ability to influence others, physical strength

- Can come apart from autonomy as self-governance; e.g. mad King George had enormous power but not rational autonomy

# How new media undermines rational autonomy

Castro & Pham: the market in new media both weakens our rational autonomy (cogntive agency) and exploits our weakened autonomy

Ex-Google strategist James Williams:

> "The dynamics of the attention economy are structurally set up to undermine the human will"

## The Hooked Model

What is the Hooked Model?

## The habit loop

![](habit-loop.jpg)

The Hooked Model exploits something that behavioral psychologists call the "Habit Loop"

## Steps in the Hooked Model

1. **Trigger** the user - bring notification to app using e.g. notifications
2. **Queue an action** - that will be done in anticipation of a reward
3. **Give a variable reward** - tie the action to outcomes that are sometimes very rewarding (perhaps a slew of “likes”) and at other times mundane (perhaps *another* picture of an acquaintance’s cat).  
4. **Investment** - have the user "put something into the product, such as a new photo or post, or their contact information, and is meant to increase the chance that the user will pass through another "Hook Cycle" in the future

## Rational autonomy and noxious markets

Castro and Pham: the market in new media is **noxious** because it both weakens our rational autonomy and exploits our weakened rational autonomy.

We typically assume that market transactions are **voluntary**, e.g. me buying a truly hideous new pair of pants.

- If we believe freedom is important, then we have a reason not to interfere with voluntary transactions -- even if participants are likely to be harmed to some degree
- Further, harms that result can be justified as consensual, at least if participants were in a position to know about the risks

But if transactions in a market are not voluntary, then the presumption against government interference is weakened

- If they're not voluntary, then they're not free, and the freedom-based argument against government interference in the market does not apply
- If they're not voluntary, then they may be coercive or exploitative -- at least plausible the government has an obligation to protect people from coercion and exploitation
- If they're not voluntary, any harms that result cannot be justified as consensual -- so there's a case for the government to step in to pretoet from those harms

# Are we obligated to be digital minimalists?

## Rational autonomy and wellbeing

You have self-interested reasons to care about your rational autonomy

- If your rational autonomy is weakened, then it will be more difficult for you to achieve your goals

## A duty to be a digital minimalist

![](81-g2qRUwAL.jpg)

Aylsworth and Castro argue that, just as you have a moral obligation to protect the rational autonomy of others, you owe it to yourself to protect your own rational autonomy

- This is supposed to be a **moral obligation**
- It's an obligation to **yourself** (self-directed duty), not others

Why? Because rational autonomy is incredibly valuable&mdash;so valuable that is deserves our protection

## The value of rational autonomy

![](Immanuel_Kant_(painted_portrait).jpg)

Immanuel Kant (1724-1804): we have a moral obligation to respect rational autonomy in ourself and in others.

Why? Because of the value of rational autonomy. Its value is:

1. **Objective:** "is one that holds for all rational agents, and this is contrasted with relative value, which requires the presence of a contingent inclination. For instance, the value of a chocolate cake is merely relative, because it has value only insofar as agents desire it."
2. **Unconditional:** "Value of this kind cannot be lost, and it holds in all contexts."
3. **Non-fungible:** "human beings have the kind of value that does not admit of exchanges for things of equal value."

Since rational autonomy is so incredibly valuable, we are morally obligated to **respect** it in both ourselves and in others

## Respect for rational autonomy

Kant thought that showing respect for rational autonomy requires never using others in ways they would not consent to

- Many nonconsequentialist philosophers, like Nozick, have agreed

Kant also thought that respecting autonomy in yourself requires protecting your own autonomy 

- Kant argued on that basis that you are morally obligated not to commit suicide

## A&C on the duty to protect our rational autonomy

A&C don't necessarily agree about that, but they do think that we have a moral obligation to protect our rational economy in various ways.

- For example, if staying up late every night partying and never getting enough sleep would undermine your ability to set rational goals and behave in ways that are conducive to promoting them, then you have a moral obligation not to do that
- Similarly, A&C think we plausibly owe it to ourselves to protect ourselves from physical addictions that would impair our autonomy

But they think that smartphone addiction plausibly has an even more severe effect on our autonomy than other kinds of addictions. Two reasons:

1. Because it leads us to spend time doing things new media companies want us to do, rather than the things *we* want to do
2. Because it produces a state of constant distractedness that makes us less effective at pursuing our goals

Since we have a duty to protect our rational autonomy, then, we have a duty to protect ourselves from smartphone addiction by becoming digital minimalists.
