      ## The attention economy
      
      ![](original.jpg)
      
      "The economic market in **new media** services"
      
      **New media** = "highly interactive and requires some form of computing for its operation"
      
      * Websites
      * Video games
      * Social media 
      
      ???
      
      Pretty obvious that Castro & Pham are almost exclusively interested in social media platforms
      
      - Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube
      
      Contrast is with **old media** (e.g. television, newspapers, magazines, radio)

      1. Ad-based
      2. Big data
      3. Social networks

      ## A noxious market?
      
      ![](clinton-castro---philosophy.jpg)
      
      Castro & Pham: the attention economy is a **noxious market**
      
      - What does this mean?

      # Noxious Markets

      What is a noxious market?

      # Advantages of free markets
      
      ![](25view.large1.jpg)
      
      1. Optimality
      2. Freedom
      
      ???
      
      "Those who defend “the market” typically do so in terms of two favorable characteristics that it is thought to possess: optimality and freedom. Markets are thought to promote optimality in the sense that conditions of long-run perfect competition among market actors tend to lead to a Pareto-optimal distribution of resources.2 Markets are thought to promote freedom, in the sense that they allow individuals to act autonomously and voluntarily. The two favorable characteristics of markets, in turn, suggest two ethical criteria against which a market in a particular good can be criticized: a criterion related to the market’s harmful effects, and a criterion related to its disrespect to agency."

      ## Noxious markets
      
      ![](71DSIAzTU3L.jpg)
      
      Markets that are **"toxic to human values"**
      
      - Organ transplantation
      - Commercial surrogacy
      - Addictive drugs
      - Child labor
      - Diamonds

      ## Quiz
      
      According to the framework discussed by Castro and Pham, what are the **four dimensions** along which a market can be noxious?

      The **harm** criterion
      
      1. Harms to individuals
      2. Harms to society <br><br>
      
      The **agency** criterion
      
      3. Weakened cognitive agency
      4. Vulnerability
      
      ???
      
      Satz identifies four different **dimensions** along which a market could be **morally problematic** in ways that contribute to it being **noxious**
      
      - The four dimensions are divided into two **categories**, harm and agency
      
      Harm criterion -- do market transcations tend to cause harm?
      
      - Harms to individuals -- duty of **non-maleficence**
      - Harms to society - when C&P talk about harms to society, they seem to have in mind ways in which the attention economy undermines **democracy**; Satz is also concerned about some markets contributing to **unjust social inequality**
      
      Agency criterion -- do market transactions tend to "somehow reflect weakened agency"?
      
      - The two parts of the agency criterion reflect two different ways in which market transactions could **fail to be voluntary**
      - Weakened cognitive agency -- are market participants in a position to **make choices autonomously**? (addicts, young children)
      - Vulnerability -- does participants in the market **exploit** the **vulnerabilities** of others? (sweatshop labor)
        - **Vulnerabilities** = "urgent and non-negotiable needs."

      ## Noxious markets
      
      ![](71DSIAzTU3L.jpg)
      
      If a market is noxious, then we have a reason to **interfere with the free market** by **regulating the relevant transactions**

      ## Harms to individuals
      
      The attention economy makes people **lonely**, **unhappy**, **depressed**, and **suicidal**
      
      ???
      
      We discussed this to some extent last week when we talked about Instagram's allegedly harmful effects on teens
      
      C&P point to research that shows the phenomenon is much more general
      
      It's easy to explain why this would be morally problematic in terms of beneficence and non-maleficence
      
      ---
      
      ## Harms to society
      
      The attention economy harms society by facilitating the development of **niche interest groups**
      
      1. What does this mean?
      2. How and why is the attention economy supposed to do this?
      3. Why is it supposed to be harmful to society?
      
      ???
      
      Effects of niche interest groups: extremism, polarization, filter bubbles
      
      ---
      
      ## Weakened cognitive agency
      
      Participants in the attention economy often participate under conditions of **weakened cognitive agency**
      
      1. What does this mean?
      2. How and why is the attention economy supposed to do this?
      3. Why is it supposed to be morally problematic?

      ## The Hooked Model
      
      ![](61flY+vDb9L.jpg)
      
      1. Trigger the user
      2. Queue an action
      3. Variable reward
      4. Investment
      
      ???
      
      The process of manufacturing habits turns out to be quite simple. The “Hooked Model” breaks it down into four steps. First, “trigger” the user; bring their attention to the app (via, for example, a notifica- tion). Second, queue an action that will be done in the anticipation of a reward. This can be as simple as getting a user to check their messages or click on photos in their News Feed. Third, give a vari- able reward — that is, tie the action to outcomes that are sometimes very rewarding (perhaps a slew of “likes”) and at other times mundane (perhaps *another* picture of an acquaintance’s cat). ... The last step of the Hooked Model, “investment”, involves having the user put something into the product, such as a new photo or post, or their contact information, and is meant to increase the chance that the user will pass through another
      
      “Hook cycle” in the future.

      ## Why is weakened agency problematic?
      
      Weakened agency undermines **voluntariness**, and so
      
      1. Undermines justification for **enforcement**
      2. Undermines justification for **harms** as consensual
      3. Creates danger of **coercion** and **exploitation**
      
      ???
      
      We typically assume that market transactions are **voluntary**, e.g. me buying a new pair of pants.
      
      - That's why it is typically appropriate to treat them as **enforceable** + to hold people **responsible** for the **consequences** of their participation
      
      But if transactions are not voluntary, then 
      
      1. justification for **enforcement** of transactions is undermined; 
      2. problematic to hold people **responsible for harms** that they experience as a result;
      3. market transactions may be **unfair** in virtue of being **coercive** or **exploitative**

      ## Vulnerabilities
      
      The attention economy **endenders and exploits our vulnerabilities**
      
      1. What does this mean?
      2. How and why is the attention economy supposed to do this?
      3. Why is it supposed to be morally problematic?
      
      ???
      
      **Vulnerabilities** = "urgent and non-negotiable needs." 
      
      ---
      
      ## Vulnerabilities
      
      The attention economy **endenders and exploits our vulnerabilities**
      
      > "For many teens, engagement with new media feels&mdash;and perhaps is&mdash;mandatory. 
      >
      > This is not just the case for teens. Increasingly, adult new media users don't have a choice whether or not to participate in the attention economy."

      # Regulatory proposal
      
      ![](60188_v2.jpg)
      
      Our regulatory strategy involves a form of product labeling. One radical way of implementing this strategy involves mandatory, unskip- pable warnings: digital applications, websites, and platforms might carry a warning to the effect of “CAUTION: THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS DETERMINED THAT EXCESSIVE SCREEN TIME IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.”
