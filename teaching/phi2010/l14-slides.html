      Media that is "**highly interactive** and requires some form of **computing** for its operation"
      
      * Websites
      * Video games
      * Social media 
      
      ???
      
      Pretty obvious that Castro & Pham are almost exclusively interested in social media platforms
      
      - Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube
      
      Contrast is with **old media** (e.g. television, newspapers, magazines, radio)

      ## Are you addicted to new media?
      
      1. How many times a day do you unlock your phone?
      2. How many hours a day do you spend interacting with new media (social media/video games/websites)
      3. Would you be better off if you used new media less?
      4. Do you find it difficult to control how much you use new media?
      
      ???
      
      1. How many times a day do you unlock your phone?
      2. How many hours a day do you spend interacting with new media (social media/video games/websites)
      3. Would you be better off if you used new media less?
      4. Do you find it difficult to control how much you use new media?
      
      Average American unlocks phone about 50 times a day (Eyal reports a higher number in his book, about 150 times per day)
      
      Average screen time since the pandemic - jumped from 4 to 6 hours (not all on new media)
      
      1/3 of Americans would rather give up sex than their phones (C&M)

      # Advantages of free markets
      
      ![](25view.large1.jpg)
      
      1. Optimality
      2. Freedom
      
      ???
      
      "Those who defend “the market” typically do so in terms of two favorable characteristics that it is thought to possess: optimality and freedom. Markets are thought to promote optimality in the sense that conditions of long-run perfect competition among market actors tend to lead to a Pareto-optimal distribution of resources.2 Markets are thought to promote freedom, in the sense that they allow individuals to act autonomously and voluntarily. The two favorable characteristics of markets, in turn, suggest two ethical criteria against which a market in a particular good can be criticized: a criterion related to the market’s harmful effects, and a criterion related to its disrespect to agency."

      ## Noxious markets
      
      ![](71DSIAzTU3L.jpg)
      
      Markets that are **"toxic to human values"**
      
      - Organ transplantation
      - Commercial surrogacy
      - Addictive drugs
      - Child labor
      - Diamonds

      ## Noxious markets
      
      According to the framework discussed by Castro and Pham, what are the **four dimensions** along which a market can be noxious?

      ## Noxious markets
      
      ![](71DSIAzTU3L.jpg)
      
      The **harm** criterion
      
      1. Harms to individuals
      2. Harms to society <br><br>
      
      The **agency** criterion
      
      3. Weakened cognitive agency
      4. Vulnerability
      
      ???
      
      Satz identifies four different **dimensions** along which a market could be **morally problematic** in ways that contribute to it being **noxious**
      
      - The four dimensions are divided into two **categories**, harm and agency
      
      Harm criterion -- do market transcations tend to cause harm?
      
      - Harms to individuals -- duty of **non-maleficence**
      - Harms to society - when C&P talk about harms to society, they seem to have in mind ways in which the attention economy undermines **democracy**; Satz is also concerned about some markets contributing to **unjust social inequality**
      
      Agency criterion -- do market transactions tend to "somehow reflect weakened agency"?
      
      - The two parts of the agency criterion reflect two different ways in which market transactions could **fail to be voluntary**
      - Weakened cognitive agency -- are market participants in a position to **make choices autonomously**? (addicts, young children)
      - Vulnerability -- does participants in the market **exploit** the **vulnerabilities** of others? (sweatshop labor)
        - **Vulnerabilities** = "urgent and non-negotiable needs."

      ## Noxious markets
      
      ![](71DSIAzTU3L.jpg)
      
      If a market is noxious, then we have a reason to **interfere with the free market** by **regulating the relevant transactions**

      # Is the attention economy noxious?
      
      ---
      
      ## Harms to individuals
      
      Does the attention economy harm individuals? If so, how?
      
      Focus on your individual case:
      
      1. In what ways do social media/smartphone use make your life better?
      2. In what ways do social media/smartphone use make your life worse?
      3. Would you be better off if you didn't have a smartphone/access to social media?
      
      ???
      
      C&P point to research that shows the phenomenon is much more general
      
      The attention economy makes people **lonely**, **unhappy**, **depressed**, and **suicidal**

      ## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"
      
      "Thirty-two percent of teen girls said that when they felt bad about their bodies, Instagram made them feel worse."
      
      "Comparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves."
      
      "We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls."
      
      "Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression. This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups."
      
      ???
      
      Here are some quotes from Facebook's own research into the effects Instagram has on teens
      
      ---
      
      ## "Facebook Knows Instagram is Toxic for Teen Girls"
      
      "The research that we've seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits"
      
      &mdash;Mark Zuckerberg (Facebook CEO)
      
      "There's a lot of good that comes with what we do."
      
      &mdash;Adam Mosseri (Instagram CEO)
      
      ???
      
      One way Facebook leaders have tried to defend the company: arguing that Instagram has many positive effects on mental health, and that the harms affect a minority of users
      
      ---
      
      ## Discussion questions
      
      1. Is Facebook morally obligated to modify Instagram in ways that would reduce its harmful effects on teens? Why or why not?
      
      2. What is Facebook obligated to do about the problem, if anything?
      3. Suppose further research provides abundant evidence that using Instagram significantly raises some teens' risk of being harmed in serious ways&mdash;that it significantly raises their risk of mental illness (anxiety, depression, eating disorders) and suicide. Would Facebook be obligated to shut the site down or take similarly drastic measures, at least until the problem is fixed? Why or why not?
      
      ---
      
      ## Harms to society
      
      The attention economy harms society by facilitating the development of **niche interest groups**
      
      1. What do C&M mean by "nice interest groups"?
      2. How and why do new media platforms facilitate the development of these groups?
      3. Why is that supposed to be morally problematic?
      
      ???
      
      Effects of niche interest groups: extremism, polarization, filter bubbles
      
      ---
      
      ## Weakened cognitive agency
      
      Participants in the attention economy often participate under conditions of **weakened cognitive agency**
      
      1. What is weakened cognitive agency?
      2. How, supposedly, do new media platforms "engender" weakened cognitive agency?
      3. Why is that supposed to be morally problematic?

      class: img-right-full
      
      ## The Hooked Model
      
      ![](61flY+vDb9L.jpg)
      
      1. Trigger the user
      2. Queue an action
      3. Variable reward
      4. Investment
      
      ???
      
      **Trigger** the user - bring notification to app using e.g. notifications
      
      **Queue an action** - that will be done in anticipation of a reward
      
      **Give a variable reward** - tie the action to outcomes that are sometimes very rewarding (perhaps a slew of “likes”) and at other times mundane (perhaps *another* picture of an acquaintance’s cat).  
      
      **Investment** - have the user "put something into the product, such as a new photo or post, or their contact information, and is meant to increase the chance that the user will pass through another "Hook Cycle"
      
      “Hook cycle” in the future.
      
      ---
      
      ## Why is weakened agency problematic?
      
      Weakened agency undermines **voluntariness**, and so
      
      1. Undermines justification for **enforcement**
      2. Undermines justification for **harms** as consensual
      3. Creates danger of **coercion** and **exploitation**
      
      ???
      
      We typically assume that market transactions are **voluntary**, e.g. me buying a new pair of pants.
      
      - That's why it is typically appropriate to treat them as **enforceable** + to hold people **responsible** for the **consequences** of their participation
      
      But if transactions are not voluntary, then 
      
      1. justification for **enforcement** of transactions is undermined; 
      2. problematic to hold people **responsible for harms** that they experience as a result;
      3. market transactions may be **unfair** in virtue of being **coercive** or **exploitative**

      ## Vulnerabilities
      
      The attention economy **endenders and exploits our vulnerabilities**
      
      1. What does this mean?
      2. How and why is the attention economy supposed to do this?
      3. Why is it supposed to be morally problematic?
      
      ???
      
      **Vulnerabilities** = "urgent and non-negotiable needs." 
      
      ---
      
      ## Vulnerabilities
      
      The attention economy **endenders and exploits our vulnerabilities**
      
      > "For many teens, engagement with new media feels&mdash;and perhaps is&mdash;mandatory. 
      >
      > This is not just the case for teens. Increasingly, adult new media users don't have a choice whether or not to participate in the attention economy."
      
      ???
      
      Is this true?

      # Regulatory proposal
      
      ![](60188_v2.jpg)
      
      > Our regulatory strategy involves a form of product labeling. One radical way of implementing this strategy involves mandatory, unskippable warnings: digital applications, websites, and platforms might carry a warning to the effect of “CAUTION: THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES HAS DETERMINED THAT EXCESSIVE SCREEN TIME IS DANGEROUS TO YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.”
      
      Is this a good solution? Should social media companies do this?

      Is this a good solution?
