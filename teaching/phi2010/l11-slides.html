      ## The first shipowner
      
      ![](popeye.jpg)
      
      > A shipowner was about to send to sea an emigrant-ship. He knew that she was old, and not over-well built at the first; that she had seen many seas and climes, and often had needed repairs. Doubts had been suggested to him that possibly she was not seaworthy.
      
      ???
      
      Then what happens?
      
      Should we judge the first shipowner harshly? Why or why not?

      ## The second shipowner
      
      ![](popeye.jpg)
      
      > Let us alter the case a little, and suppose that the ship was not unsound after all; that she made her voyage safely, and many others after it. Will that diminish the guilt of her owner?
      
      ???
      
      Should we judge the second shipowner harshly? Why or why not?

      ## Two questions
      
      ![](j9pwdrny-1413258154.jpg)
      
      1. Is belief in God epistemically rational?
      2. Is belief in God practically rational?
      
      ---
      
      class: img-left-full
      
      ## Epistemically rational?
      
      ![](j9pwdrny-1413258154.jpg)
      
      **Anselm:** Yes. The fact that we can think about a perfect being entails that a perfect being exists.
      
      **Paley:** Yes. The best explanation for the existence of plants and animals is that they were created by an intelligent designer.
      
      **Antony:** No. The suffering we observe is excellent evidence that a perfect being does not exist.
      
      ---
      
      class: img-left-full
      
      ## Practically rational?
      
      ![](j9pwdrny-1413258154.jpg)
      
      **Pascal:** Yes. Even though believing in God is not epistemically rational, believing in God is practically rational because doing so dominates the other options / maximizes expected utility.

      # Clifford on the ethics of belief
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ## W.K. Clifford (1845-1879)
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      - English mathematician and philosopher
      - Invented Clifford algebra (important in math, physics, computing)
      - Coined "mind-stuff"
      - Looks like a shipowner
      
      ---
      
      class: standout
      
      ## "It is wrong, always and everywhere, to believe without evidence"

      # What's the upshot?
      
      .col[
      
      **Shipowner 1**
      
      - Suppresses doubts
      - Fails to investigate

      - Ship sinks
      
      ]
      
      .rc[
      
      **Shipowner 2**
      
      - Suppresses doubts
      - Fails to investigate
      - Belief is true
      - Ship doesn't sink
      
      ]
      
      ???
      
      Clifford thinks that we should judge both shipowners harshly
      
      What conclusion does Clifford draw about the ethics of belief?
      
      ---
      
      ## The two shipowners
      
      Both shipowners do something morally wrong: **believing without evidence** that the ship is seaworthy
      
      --
      
      >  The question of right or wrong has to do with the **origin of his belief**, not the matter of it; not what it was, but how he got it; not whether it turned out to be true or false, but whether he had a right to believe on such evidence as was before him...
      
      ---
      
      ## Worry 1: wrong actions, not wrong beliefs
      
      Isn't it what the shipowner **does** that is morally wrong, not what he **believes**?
      
      --
      
      > It may be said, however, that . . . it is not the belief which is judged to be wrong, but the action following on it. The shipowner might say, "I am perfectly certain that my ship is sound, but still I feel it my duty to have her examined, before trusting the lives of so many people to her."
      
      ???
      
      **Response:** this is true as far as it goes, but it's not the whole story
      
      - The shipowner does something wrong **even if** he subsequently has the ship checked out
      - Quote on next slide
      
      ---
      
      ## Worry 1: wrong actions, not wrong beliefs
      
      Isn't it what the shipowner **does** that is morally wrong, not what he **believes**?
      
      > "It is not possible so to sever the belief from the action it suggests as to condemn the one without condemning the other. No man holding a strong belief on one side of a question ... can investigate it with such fairness and completeness as if he were really in doubt and unbiased; so that the existence of a belief not founded on fair inquiry, unfits a man for the performance of this necessary duty."
      
      ---
      
      ## Clifford's analysis
      
      The shipowner has done two things wrong:
      
      1. Forming a **risky belief** insufficient evidence
      2. Taking a **risky action** on the basis of that belief
      
      ???
      
      The original belief was wrong in part because merely having the belief put the passengers in danger
      
      --
      
      ### Worry 2
      
      At most, the shipowner example shows that forming beliefs about potentially dangerous matters without sufficient evidence is wrong. What about **less important** beliefs?
      
      ???
      
      You might be tempted to think that the lesson to draw here is that we shouldn't believe without evidence **when being wrong is potentially dangerous**
      
      Pascal, for instance, says that whether God exists or not makes absolutely no practical difference -- except when it comes to the prospect of eternal salvation

      ## Worry 2: trivial beliefs
      
      ![](napoleononatrex.png)
      
      Jones has a boring job and no friends, but he has a hobby that keeps him amused. He stays up late thinking about dinosaurs and forming wild hypotheses about what they were like. Jones has **no evidence** for these hypotheses, but he sometimes believes them because it makes him happy. He never acts on his beliefs and **never talks to anyone** about them.
      
      ???
      
      Is Jones doing anything wrong?
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ## Worry 2: trivial beliefs
      
      ![](napoleononatrex.png)
      
      Why does Clifford thing that it is **always** wrong to believe on insufficient evidence, even if the belief in question seems **completely unimportant** and even if there is little risk that the believer will **tell anyone else**?
      
      ---
      
      ## 
      
      "No one man's belief is in any case a private matter which concerns himself alone. Our lives are guided by that general conception of the course of things which has been created by society for social purposes. Our words, our phrases, our forms and processes and modes of thought, are common property, fashioned and perfected from age to age; an heirloom, which every succeeding generation inherits as a precious deposit and a sacred trust, to be handed on to the next one, not unchanged, but enlarged and purified, with some clear marks of its proper handiwork. Into this, for good or ill, is woven every belief of every man who has speech of his fellows. An awful privilege, and an awful responsibility, that we should help to create the world in which posterity will live."

      class: img-right-full
      
      ## Worry 2: trivial beliefs
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      We have a **sacred duty** to safeguard the collective knowledge we have inherited
      
      ???
      
      Believing without evidence is a violation of that sacred duty
      
      If you don't find that persuasive, Clifford has a backup argument
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ## Worry 2: trivial beliefs
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      Believing without evidence leads to **credulousness**, which
      
      1. leads to dangerous false beliefs
      
      ???
      
      If we get in the habit of being credulous, we'll eventually form some potentially dangerous false beliefs, and may even share them with others
      
      Why else does Clifford think it is morally wrong to be credulous?
      
      --
      
      1. prevents us from contributing to human knowledge
      
      ???
      
      Credulousness prevents us from contributing to our collective inheritance of human knowledge, which are obligated to do
      
      --
      
      1. is contagious
      
      ???
      
      If we're credulous, others might become credulous too -- both by seeing our example, and because we're not doing our part to maintain the social norm that that you should be careful about what you believe
      
      --
      
      1. encourages deception
      
      ???
      
      The social norm of truth-telling is based on our mutual respect for each other as careful believers -- people who do their best not to believe without adequate evidence
      
      - If other people know you are careless about what you believe, they will have less reason to be careful about what they tell you
      - So being credulous can undermine the social norm that requires us to be honest -- with terrible consequences

      ## Religious faith
      
      ![](9145-woman-praying-gettyimages-made-suta-eyeem.jpg)
      
      Clifford is widely interpreted as attacking **religious faith**
      
      - Why do you think that is?
      
      ???
      
      Despite not saying much about religion in the essay
      
      --
      
      What would Clifford say about **Pascal's wager**?

      # Beyond personal experience
      
      ---
      
      ## Worry 3: skepticism
      
      Won't refusing to believe anything without sufficient evidence lead us to **doubt everything**, and so be **completely paralyzed**?
      
      > Are we then to become universal skeptics, doubting everything, afriad always to put one foot before the other until we have personally tested the firmness of the road? Are we to deprive ourselves of the help and guidance of that vast body of knowledge which is daily growing upon the world, because neither we nor any one person can possibly test a hundredth part of it by immediate experiment or observation?
      
      ???
      
      Why might someone have this worry?
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ## Worry 3: skepticism
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      Never believing on insufficient evidence is consistent with living a **normal life**
      
      ???
      
      It's not obvious why this would be true, given what Clifford has said
      
      He realizes that he needs to say more
      
      - Specifically, he needs to tell us more about what counts as "sufficient evidence," and why sufficient evidence is often available to us
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ## Worry 3: skepticism
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      "Because is not enough to say 'It is wrong to believe on unworthy evidence,' without saying also what evidence is worthy, we shall now go on to inquire under what circumstances it is lawful to believe on the testimony of others; and then, further, we shall inquire more generally when and why we may believe that which goes beyond our own experience, or even beyond the experience of mankind."
      
      ---
      
      ## Worry 3: skepticism
      
      Clifford needs to explain why it is permissible to believe things on the basis of:
      
      1. **Testimony**
      2. Knowledge by **induction**/**abduction**
      
      ---
      
      ## Testimony
      
      Can't we learn things from others, without needing to observe them for ourselves?
      
      ---
      
      ## Testimony
      
      >  "In what cases ... is the **testimony** of a man unworthy of belief?"
      
      --
      
      We need to have reason to doubt his:
      
      1. **Veracity**
      2. **Knowledge**
      3. **Judgment**
      
      ???
      
      Veracity -- that he's telling the truth
      
      Knowledge -- that he has had the opportunity to learn what he claims to know
      
      Judgment -- that he's actually taken proper advantage of those opportunities
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      # Testimony
      
      ![](fig1-14.jpg)
      
      Suppose your physics professor tells you that the universe is expanding
      
      1. Are there any reasons to doubt that he is speaking the truth?
      2. Would Clifford say that it is morally permissible to believe him?
      3. Would Clifford say that you have an obligation to investigate?
      
      ---
      
      ## Learning from experience
      
      Don't we believe without evidence every time we treat the **past** as a guide to the **future**? (Isn't that rational?)
      
      > A burnt child dreads the fire, because it believes that the fire will burn it today just as it did yesterday; but this belief goes beyond experience, and assumes that the unknown fire of today is like the known fire of yesterday.
      
      --
      
      According to Clifford, is the child's belief **morally wrong**? Why or why not?
      
      ---
      
      ## Learning from experience
      
      > We may believe what goes beyond our experience, only when it is inferred from that experience by the **assumption** that what we do not know is like what we know.
      
      --
      
      What **evidence** do we have that this assumption is true? Can Clifford explain why it is **permissible** to believe it?
      
      ---
      
      class: img-right-full
      
      ![](PSM_V15_D156_William_Kingdon_Clifford.jpg)
      
      1. Believing on **insufficient evidence** is always morally wrong
      2. We may believe on the basis of **testimony**, provided "there is reasonable ground for supposing that he knows the matter of which he speaks, and that he is speaking the truth as far as he knows it"
      3. We may believe what goes **beyond experience**, provided we are guided by the assumption that "what we do not know is like what we know"
