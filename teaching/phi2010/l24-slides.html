# L24 Death and the Afterlife

---

## Parfit's question

**Parfit's question:** how much does personal identity really matter?

???

One question that Parfit is interested in is this: how much should we care about our ongoing survival, and why?

--

- **Survival** matters primarily because **psychological continuity** matters
- Psychological continuity matters because there will be a future person who will **promote your goals and carry out your projects**

- Even psychological continuity doesn't matter that much, provided your goals are accomplished!



???

Parfit believes that fission cases show that our ongoing survival doesn't matter very much in itself. Instead, the primary reason that we have to care about our ongoing survival is that when we survive, there is a future person who is psychologically continuous with us, and who will presumably go on to carry out our life projects and promote our goals.

But once we see this, he thinks we'll see that even psychological continuity doesn't matter all that much. What really matters is whether our projects are carried out and our goals are accomplished—regardless of who actually sees to it that they are completed

The result will be that we will become less egocentric—we'll start to care about others in more or less the same way that we care about ourselves

Your mileage may vary

## Scheffler on the afterlife

**Scheffler's question:** if all life on Earth ended after our deaths, how would we react? And does that tell us about what really matters to us?

???

Scheffler asks a different question: if the world was about to end, how much would that change what we care about? And does that tell us about what matters to us?

Scheffler argues that thinking about these questions will lead us to conclude that we're not as self-centered as we might have thought

## Scheffler on the afterlife

**Scheffler's question:** if all life on Earth ended after our deaths, how would we react? And does that tell us about what really matters to us?

- **The Eternal Afterlife**—eternal life of you and people you know following physical death

- **The Social Afterlife**—life on Earth (and especially human life) continuing after we die

???

Scheffler doesn't believe in an afterlife in the traditional sense: he thinks that once our bodies die, that's it. We aren't resurrected in heaven, or reincarnated as some newly born person, or anything like that.

But Scheffler does believe in an afterlife in a different sense: after we die, life on Earth continues. 

- Scheffler thinks that the afterlife in this sense is very, very important to us. 
- In particular, he thinks that our committment to many of the personal projects we are committed to depends on our belief that when we die, other people will go on living, and that our actions while we are alive will continue to affect what happens to people who exist in the future

## The Doomsday scenario

"Suppose you knew that, although you yourself would live a normal life span, the Earth would be **completely destroyed** thirty days after your death in a collision with a giant asteroid. How would this knowledge **affect your attitudes during** the remainder of your life?"

--

1. How would you **react emotionally** to this knowledge?
2. How would it change **how you spend your time**?
3. What do you currently hope to accomplish in life? How would this knowledge **change your goals and priorities**?

--

4. What do your reactions tell you about your **values**—what you think matters—and **motivations**—why you do the things you do?

---

## Two general upshots about our values

**Point 1:** our values are **nonexperientialist** = we don't just care about what experiences we have

--

**Point 2:** our values are **conservative** = we want the things we care about to continue existing/flourishing in the longer term

---

## Dependence of our goals on the afterlife

How would being in the Doomsday scenario affect our **goals**?

1. Less **reason** to engage in certain activities/projects
2. Belief that certain activities/projects are **worthwhile** would weaken

--

### Questions

1. What kinds of activities/projects are **vulnerable** to being affected in this way?

2. Are there some kinds of activities/projects that would **not be affected** as much?

---

## Dependence of our goals on the afterlife

What kinds of activities/projects are **most vulnerable**?

1. ultimate success may be far in the future
2. value of the activity/project depends on benefits to many over a long time

???

Examples:

-  finding a cure for cancer
- social and political activism
- scientific research

---

# Dependence of our goals on the afterlife

How would our **motivation** to engage in the following be affected by the Doomsday scenario?

- Creative/artistic projects
- Having children
- How we raise/care for children

---

## Upshots

1. Our motivation for engaging in many of our projects/activities depends on our belief that doing so will have **ongoing effects** after we die—that engaging in them will help **promote the things we value** after our deaths

--

2. People are **less self-centered/egoistic** than we might assume

???

A lot of what we do, we do not because we care about how our own lives go, but because we care about how things go for others—both people who are currently alive, and people who will exist in the future

--

### Question

Is Scheffler right? Does the Doomsday scenario show these things?

## The Eternal Life scenario

"Suppose you discover, beyond any doubt, that **no one really dies**. After you bodily death, you will live on in heaven or on another planet with many of the people you have known in this life. And you will live forever. Would this discovery affect what you care about in this life?"

--

1. How would you **react emotionally** to this knowledge?
2. How would it change **how you spend your time**?
3. What do you currently hope to accomplish in life? How would this knowledge **change your goals and priorities**?

4. What do your reactions tell you about your **values**—what you think matters—and **motivations**—why you do the things you do?

???

From the textbook: "If it would, then you have discovered that some things that seem to matter for their own sake only matter to us because our lives are finite. That would be an interesting discovery."
